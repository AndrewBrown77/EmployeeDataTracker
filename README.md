# EmployeeDataTracker

Description:
 SQL Employee Data Tracker is a software application or system that uses an SQL database to manage, organize, and track employee-related information. It enables users (such as HR managers, business administrators, or team leaders) to interact with employee data, such as roles, departments, managers, and salaries, through a user interface. The SQL database serves as the storage layer for all employee records, and the application typically provides features for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) employee data.
